# phlote-viz

9/23/24 4am - Adandoning StackGL as a library because the resources are scarce, and the documentation is lacking. I'm going to try to use plain WebGL and ThreeJS. I made the phlote path in inkscape and extruded it in Blender. I'm going to try to make a scene with it and add a shader to it.

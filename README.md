# phlote-viz

9/23/24 4am - Adandoning StackGL as a library because the resources are scarce, and the documentation is lacking. I'm going to try to use plain WebGL and ThreeJS. I made the phlote path in inkscape and extruded it in Blender. I'm going to try to make a scene with it and add a shader to it. 
9/25/24 2:25pm: Great progress on finding a way to work with the glsl language in a single HTML file...the 3D asset that I made is an issue, it's not being exported correctly, and the GTLF uploader script on it's own was not giving me a lot of hope...soon switching to a full NextJS project after I have understood everything in this HTML version.

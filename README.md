9/22/24 1am - Been away from this for some time. I wanted to complete this before anything else but here I am backtracking...I've made progress outside of this repo in figma, inkscape, and blender. 

checking in with a simple raymarched SDF scene using glslify. I was experiencing some issues with glslify not compiling properly, I added the library that I needed to add but now I have to look at if ithe shader is actually something that is working.

I'm going to try to add a few more primitives and see if I can get at least one of them to work.
